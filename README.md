Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.
Log in to your GitHub account or create one if you don't have one.
Click on the New button (usually found on the left sidebar or on your GitHub profile page).
Fill in the repository details:
Repository name: BookUpdateApp (or your preferred name)
Description: A Spring Boot application to update book records in a MySQL database.
Choose visibility: Public or Private.
Click on the Create repository button.
Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
Copy the repository URL from the GitHub repository page.
Open a terminal or Git Bash and run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BookUpdateApp.git
Step 3: Add the README.md File
Inside the cloned repository on your local machine, create a README.md file.
Add the contents provided in the previous response (the README.md content).
Save the file.
Step 4: Push the Changes to GitHub
Open your terminal or Git Bash in the root directory of the repository.
Run the following commands to push the README.md to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README.md"
git push origin main
Note: If your default branch is master, use master instead of main in the above commands.

Step 5: Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository page.
You should now see the README.md file displayed in the repository.
